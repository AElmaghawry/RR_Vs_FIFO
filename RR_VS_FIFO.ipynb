    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux scheduler is a method that decide which process needed to be excuted \n",
    "There are a lot of Algorithms that could be used for the schedular , those algorithms are differ than each other, and it depends on the applications and the perofrmance \n",
    "\n",
    "on this task we are going to test a couple of technqiues and measure the performance of each one \n",
    "those teqhniques are \"First In and First out\" and \"Round Robin\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Inorder to measure the performance of any scheduling techqnies. there is a couple of terms needed to be defined: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfomance Paramters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compliation time**: is the time for any process to complete its excution  \n",
    "* **Turn arround Time** : is the time diffrence between the start of the process and its compliation\n",
    "* **Brust time** : is the expected time for any process to be excuted without any intrupt  \n",
    "* **Waiting time** : is the diffrence between the turn arround time and brust time  \n"
