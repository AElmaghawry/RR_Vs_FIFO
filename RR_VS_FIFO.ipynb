    "Linux scheduler is a method that decide which process needed to be excuted \n",

    "on this task we are going to test a couple of technqiues and measure the performance of each one \n",
    "those teqhniques are \"First In and First out\" and \"Round Robin\"\n",

    "* **Compliation time (ct)**: is the time for any process to complete its excution  \n",
    "* **Turn arround Time (tt)** : is the time diffrence between the start of the process and its compliation\n",
    "* **Brust time (bt)** : is the expected time for any process to be excuted without any intrupt  \n",
    "* **Waiting time (wt)** : is the diffrence between the turn arround time and brust time.\n",
    "* **Quantum Time** : is the avilable time for each  \n",
